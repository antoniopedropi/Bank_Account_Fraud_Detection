# Bank Account Fraud Detection

This assignment focused on detecting fraudulent applications in an online bank account opening system. In this scenario, fraudsters attempt to gain access to banking services by using stolen identities or by creating fictitious individuals. Once a fraudulent account is granted, the attacker quickly exploits credit lines or uses the account to receive illicit payments, leaving the bank to absorb the losses.
The objective of the project was to analyze a dataset of applications containing 37 features and a fraud_bool label, and to recommend and implement a predictive modelling solution that accurately identifies fraudulent applications. The work also involved preparing and submitting predictions to a Kaggle competition using the provided test data.
Task 1 involved understanding and preparing the data, summarizing and visualizing the main characteristics of the applications, identifying possible quality issues, and performing any necessary data cleaning or pre-processing. This stage also included exploratory clustering to extract insights.
Task 2 focused on predictive modelling: defining the dataset for classification, experimenting with and comparing different models, and justifying the choice of the final approach based on performance and interpretability.

Developed as part of the Fraud Detection 23/24 assignment.
